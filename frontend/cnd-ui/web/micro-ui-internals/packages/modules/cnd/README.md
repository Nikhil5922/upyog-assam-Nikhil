# 🏗️ C&D Waste Pickup Module

## 📌 What is C&D Waste?

C&D (Construction and Demolition) waste consists of debris generated during the construction, renovation, and demolition of buildings, roads, and other structures. This includes materials like bricks, concrete, wood, steel, glass, and cement dust. Effective C&D waste management is crucial to maintaining public hygiene, reducing environmental impact, and supporting sustainable urban development.

## 💡 Why C&D Waste Management?

C&D waste is bulky, heavy, and often hazardous. Improper disposal clogs drains, damages ecosystems, and contributes to pollution. A systematic, citizen-friendly pickup system:

- Promotes proper segregation and recycling.
- Minimizes illegal dumping.
- Supports cleaner urban environments.
- Enables data-driven municipal planning and monitoring.
